# 🧠 Explainable AI–Based Analysis of Factors Influencing Student Mental Health

## 📌 Overview
Student mental health has become a critical concern in higher education due to academic pressure, financial stress, lifestyle imbalance, and psychosocial challenges. 

This project applies Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to analyze the influence of academic and lifestyle factors on student mental health in a transparent and interpretable manner using SHAP.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze academic, lifestyle, and psychosocial stress factors
- Apply interpretable machine learning models
- Use SHAP to explain feature contributions
- Provide transparent insights instead of black-box predictions

## 🏗️ Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing  
   - Missing value handling  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature scaling  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Distribution visualization  

3. Interpretable Model  
   - Logistic Regression / Decision Tree  

4. Explainability  
   - SHAP global feature importance  
   - SHAP summary plots
